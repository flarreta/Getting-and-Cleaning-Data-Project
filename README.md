The Getting and Cleaning Data course project is divided in four main
files:

1.  `README.md` &lt;- this file is a brief description of what elements
    are in the Github repository and how the script written for this
    project works.

2.  `run_analysis.R` &lt;- All the steps required in the project are run
    in this file. The code performs the preparation, cleaning and
    organization of the data. The 5 steps are the following:

-   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.

-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set

-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

-   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

1.  `CODEBOOK.md` &lt;- This file has the description of the variables,
    the data, and any transformations done for the project.

2.  `Final_Data.txt` &lt;- final file created with the script detailed
    above.
